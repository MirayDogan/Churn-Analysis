Customer loyalty can be shaken because of the easy access to the products and the fact that there are too many alternatives in the sector. The aim is to develop a data-driven solution on the basis of minimizing loss rates and ultimately helping us increase customer satisfaction and corporate revenue.

Since the business problem and hence the target variable is binary (categorical), we are going to employ classifiers sitting in both the classical/old statistical-modelling and relatively newly developing ML-modelling world.

Those can be listed as: Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Ensemble Decision Trees (XGBoost), Random Forest Classifier KNN Classifier Multi-Layer Perceptrons Our result is show that CART is the best model for this dataset.
